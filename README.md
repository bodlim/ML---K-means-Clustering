# ML---K-means-Clustering

ex7 focuses on the use of K-means Clustering algorithms for image compression, achieved by reducing the number of colors that exist in an image to those most common in it. 

ex7data2 is a 300 by 2 matrix used to demonstrate the concept to gain an inituition into how the algorithm works, while bird_small is the image of a bird that was oppressed using with the algorithm.
